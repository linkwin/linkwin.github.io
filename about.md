# About me

Hello! My name is Alan! I have been a hobby developer for about 5 years now. Most of my experience has been with the Unity game engine, however I have used many 
different engines, frameworks, and programming languages.
If you would like to see my past and current work, [check out my projects](https://linkwin.github.io/). I have a strong passion for AI programming and real time 
simulation. I feel most productive writting C# scripts in unity. I am also very proficient with Blueprints in Unreal Engine 4. I originally learned programming
in university with java and command line, which gave me solid fountational skills I have been building on ever since. I take pride in my ability to pick up new
engines and frameworks quickly. I am constantly learning new ideas and ways to be more productive and efficient. I consider myself reliable and transparent. I value
critisism highly and strive to only get better at my craft.
