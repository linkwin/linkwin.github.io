Currently in development at

#### Contributions

We are using Adventure Creator (AC) for this project, a nice game framework for making adventure games in Unity. My resposibilities so far have included:
* Art asset implementation
* Character animation setup for Player and AI
* Custom input controller script for player actions (attack, block, crouch, etc.)
* Health/Death/Respawn system integrated with AC
* AI scripting integrated with AC NPC system
* Stealth feature implementation

This is the most recent project I have been working on and it has really allowed me to flex my chops. I feel like I reached a new plateau while working on this project.
It showcases many of my strengths; Animation scripting, AI, 3rd party asset integration, gameplay framework integration.

Demo coming soon!
