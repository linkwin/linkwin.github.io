### Contributions

I have been the sole programmer on this project. We are using Unreal Engine 4 for the development. 
While much of the gameplay comes from 3rd party assets, I have written custom blueprints for the following features:

* Jetpack controller
* Aim assist for playing on gamepad
* Puzzle implementation
* Level state/ gameplay progression

Much of the work I've done so far involves modifying BP's from the assets we are using to accelerate development. 
I have used documentation and experimentation throughout the project to make a few different assets work seamlessly together.
I have listed more specifics below:

* Animation retargeting
* Animation BP modifications
* AI toolkit integration with custom spawner
* Custom 3D model implementation
