title: 'Rustys Release'
---

Made in 2 weeks for [Adventure Game Jam](https://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam), using unity with Adventure Creator asset.

### Contributions

I implemented most of the AC mechanics shown in the game. This includes:

* Game/Level state variables
* Dialog/VO implementation in engine
* Branching dialog implementation for NPC characters

I also designed and help write the branching diaolg for the boss character.
